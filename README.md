# generator-polymer-init-i18n-starter-kit

This template is a starting point for building i18n-ready apps using [I18n-ready Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/t2ym/polymer-starter-kit-i18n)
with a custom gulp process leveraging 
[polymer-build](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-build), the library 
powering [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli).

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install 
[Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli)
and generator-polymer-init-custom-build using 
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
(we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli
    npm install -g generator-polymer-init-i18n-starter-kit

##### Initialize project from template

Generate your new project using `polymer init`:

    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    polymer init i18n-starter-kit

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve --open

### Build

Rather than rely on the usual `polymer build` command, this project gives you
an "escape hatch" so you can include additional steps in your build process.

The included `gulpfile.js` relies on 
[the `polymer-build` library](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-build),
the same library that powers Polymer CLI. Out of the box it will clean the 
`build` directory, and provide image minification. Follow the comments in the 
`gulpfile.js` to add additional steps like JS transpilers or CSS preprocessors.

    gulp

### Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
in an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled

### Run tests

This command will run
[Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) against 
the browsers currently installed on your machine:

    polymer test

### Adding a new build step

The gulpfile already contains an example build step that demonstrates how to
run image minification across your source files. For more examples, refer to
the section in 
[the polymer-build README on extracting inline sources](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-build#extracting-inlined-cssjs).

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections
of the application.  Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the
list of `fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file.  This will ensure
those components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached
components (and will have bundles created in the fallback `bundled` build).
